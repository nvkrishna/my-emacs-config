stunnel TODO


High priority features.  They will likely be supported some day.
A sponsor could allocate my time to get them faster.
* Request elevated UAC privileges before editing stunnel.conf
  on Microsoft's Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later.
* Support for CryptoAPI certificates and private keys with OpenSSL CAPI engine.
* Separate GUI process running as current user on Windows.
* Separate control process running as root user on Unix.
* Indirect CRL support (RFC 3280, section 5).
* Service-level logging configuration (separate verbosity and destination).
* Configuration file option to limit the number of concurrent connections.
* SOCKS 4 protocol support.

Low priority features.  They will unlikely ever be supported.
* Provide 64-bit Windows builds (besides 32-bit builds).
  This requires either Microsoft Visual Studio Standard Edition or Microsoft
  Visual Studio Professional Edition in order to retain FIPS compliance.
* Key renegotiation (re-handshake) for long connections.
* Logging to NT EventLog on Windows.
* Internationalization of logged messages (i18n).
* Generic scripting engine instead or static protocol.c.

Features I won't support, unless convinced otherwise by a wealthy sponsor.
* Protocol support *after* SSL is negotiated:
  - Support for adding X-Forwarded-For to HTTP request headers.
  - Support for adding X-Forwarded-For to SMTP email headers.
* Additional certificate checks (including wildcard comparison) based on CN
  and X509v3 Subject Alternative Name.
* Set processes title that appear on the ps(1) and top(1) commands.
